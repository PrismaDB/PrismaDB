# Data Manipulation Statements

## SELECT

### MySQL

```
SELECT
    * | select_expression,...
    FROM source,...
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [GROUP BY column,...]
    [ORDER BY order_column,...]
    [LIMIT count]

select_expression:
    expression [[AS] alias]
  | table.*

source:
    table_reference [join_clause,...]

join_clause:
    [INNER | LEFT [OUTER] | RIGHT [OUTER] | CROSS] JOIN
    table_reference [ON column = column]

where_condition:
    expression

order_column:
    column [ASC | DESC]

table_reference:
    table [[AS] alias]
  | ( select_statement ) [AS] alias
```

- For more information on `expression`, refer to [Language Structure - Expression Syntax](../language-structure#expression-syntax)
- For more information on `table`, refer to [Language Structure - Schema Object Names (MySQL)](../language-structure#mysql_1)
- For more information on `column`, refer to [Language Structure - Schema Object Names (MySQL)](../language-structure#mysql_1)
- `alias` follows the same syntax as `table` or `column`.
- `count` is an integer literal value. For more information, refer to [Language Structure - Literal Values](../language-structure#literal-values)
- `select_statement` is a nested `SELECT` statement that follows the rules of this definition.

#### Examples

```
SELECT t1.col1, t1.col2, t1.col3 * t1.col4 AS MUL, t2.col2, t2.col3
    FROM  table1 t1
    JOIN  table2 t2 ON t1.col1 = t2.col1
    WHERE ( t1.col3 = 1 ) OR ( t2.col4 < 100 )
    ORDER BY MUL, t1.col1 DESC;
```

```
SELECT `col1`, SUM(col2)
    FROM  `table1`
    GROUP BY `col1`;
```

```
SELECT *
    FROM  table1, table2;
```
